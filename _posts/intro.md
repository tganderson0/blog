Welcome to my blog! My name is Taylor Anderson, and I am a software developer interested in computer graphics, game development, and robotics. I am currently studying for a master's/doctorate in Computer Science at USU.

## Thesis/Project

The blog for now will follow along with my progress on the master's thesis. Before that though, I'll talk about what my goals and milestones for the project/thesis are, as well as what the project even is.

For my master's thesis, I am interested in learning and working with computer graphics, specifically PBR and raytracing.

### Goals

* Gain in depth understanding of Vulkan and the rendering pipeline
* Create a physically accurate/based rendering system
* Create an efficient raytracer renderer, utilizing modern Vulkan methods
* Test and utilize multiple different denoising algorithms, allowing for easy switching between them
* Integrate rendering system with freely available physics engine
* Allow for minor scripting (Python) capabilities
* Experiment with wave-based light simulation, as opposed to only ray-based

### Milestones

1. Vulkan setup and initialization
2. Basic ambient, spectral, diffuse renderer
3. Physically based renderer
4. Basic raytracing, no denoising
5. Denoising algorithms
6. Physics engine integration
7. Python scripting capabilities
8. Skinned meshes
9. Simple animations
